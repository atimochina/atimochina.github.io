A personal project to learn HTML5, CSS, &amp; Javascript by creating a portfolio webpage for certain coding projects.

The following tutorial was utilized: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bMdjkfvONE 
credit to Jordan Hudgens for current layout of webpage

In this tutorial I learned about Flexbox and Grid templates used in CSS, basic tags for HTML5, classes in HTML5, eventListener and utilization of functions in Javascript. Further, I learned how to debug the website as it was being produced through the developer tools in Google Chrome, specifically utilizing inspect and the console to determine if Javascript code was accesing the correct data for dynamic elements.
